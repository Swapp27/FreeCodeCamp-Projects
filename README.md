# Numpystats
Performing statistical analysis using numpy

Function cal() in module stats.py checks if the input list has 9 elemnts, if yes, it arranges the list in a numpy array 3x3 matrix and performs a statitical analysis(mean,variance,standard deviation, maximum, minimum, sum) of the elements in in matrix (row-wise, column-wise, flattened matrix), if not, throws a Value error.

The test cases are in the test.py file using "unittest" module. 

The inspiration was taken from the course project on freecodecamp.org

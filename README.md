# List and description of Projects

## 1. Numpystats
Performing statistical analysis using numpy

Function cal() in module stats.py checks if the input list has 9 elemnts, if yes, it arranges the list in a numpy array 3x3 matrix and performs a statitical analysis(mean,variance,standard deviation, maximum, minimum, sum) of the elements in in matrix (row-wise, column-wise, flattened matrix), if not, throws a Value error.

## 3. Time Series Visualizer
In this project we will visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots.
We will use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03.
The data visualizations will help understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.
